We all carry an ache. We long for fulfillment, hoping that love, success, or recognition will finally satisfy the emptiness inside. Yet no matter what the world offers, the longing remains.

What if that ache is not a flaw to fix, but a clue to follow? What if the deepest desire of the human heart is simply this: to be seen and to be loved?

In *The God Who Sees: Remembering What Was Never Lost*, we are invited on a journey through the wilderness of invisibility—when we feel overlooked, forgotten, or unseen—into the healing presence of the One who sees us as we truly are. Along the way, we learn to see ourselves with gentleness, to see others with compassion, and to glimpse our place in the larger divine story.

This is not a book of quick answers or easy formulas. It is an invitation to pause, to remember, and to rest in the truth that has always been true:

*You are seen. You are loved. You are never alone.*
