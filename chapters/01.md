## Chapter 1: Not Quite Family

*“Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.”*
— *Genesis 16:1*

Hagar enters the story not as a daughter, not as a friend, not as a beloved child of God, but as a label: *“an Egyptian maidservant.”* She is defined by her position, not her personhood. She is useful, but not cherished. Present, but not embraced.

Her name is mentioned almost as an afterthought, tucked behind her role. It is a painful way to be introduced—as though her worth comes only from what she can do, not from who she is.

Many of us know that wound. We know what it feels like to be valued for our labor but overlooked as people. To be welcomed when we serve, but invisible when we stop. To be introduced by our title, our role, our function—anything but our true self.

The household of Abraham was supposed to be the place where God’s blessing dwelled. Yet even there, Hagar was treated as less-than. She lived in the tent of promise, yet was not counted as part of the promise. She was near the covenant, but never included in it.

The same happens in church life. Communities built on the words *“all are welcome”* sometimes quietly divide people into categories—leaders and followers, insiders and outsiders, the celebrated and the overlooked. You might be the one setting up chairs, running slides, singing in the background, but never invited to the table where decisions are made. You’re present, but not family. You’re necessary, but not valued.

This is where Hagar’s story begins: with the ache of being unnamed, unseen, defined only by her role. And perhaps this is where your story begins too.

But here is the quiet hope: the story does not end with labels. Hagar is more than a maidservant. And so are you. Whatever role others have used to define you, whatever titles or expectations have been placed on you, your true identity cannot be reduced to usefulness. Beneath every label is a beloved child, already known, already loved.

May you know today that you are more than the roles you have filled.
May you be reminded that your worth is not measured in tasks or titles.
And may you rest in this truth: even if others have named you only by your function, your God knows you by your name.
