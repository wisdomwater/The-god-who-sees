12. Remembering What Was Never Lost

We end where we began: already known, already seen, already loved. The journey is not about gaining God’s sight but remembering it was always there. Return to Hagar. Return to the dishes. Return to love.

Practice: Daily breath prayer: “Seen. Loved. Never alone.”
