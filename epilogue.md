## Epilogue: Still on the Way

I am still on the journey. The wilderness has not magically opened into a promised land, but it no longer feels so lonely. Along the way I have found companions I never expected—mystics, teachers, voices from traditions I once considered forbidden. They have taught me honesty, humility, and the unassuming beauty of the outsider.

I have discovered the strange joy of the sojourner: the one with no fixed home, yet who learns to find home wherever the path leads.

In this wandering, I have met a God who cannot be caged by categories or bound by sermons. A presence that is wider than doctrine, deeper than tradition, more expansive than any single faith can hold. A God who is all-inviting, the blessing of all nations, spoken of in countless ways by countless tongues.

I would not have found this God had I not been driven into the wilderness. And so, what once felt like exile has become the place of discovery. The wilderness remains, but it has become holy ground.

And so I leave you with this final blessing, for every soul who still walks the lonely road, longing to be seen:

### Final Blessing

May you find companions in the wilderness—voices that remind you you’re not alone.
May the God who cannot be contained meet you in surprising places and unexpected faces.
May the pain of exile become the soil of a deeper belonging.
May the tears you have shed water seeds of compassion.
And may you come to know, in your bones and in your breath,
that you are fully seen, fully held, and fully loved.

The wilderness may not be the end of your story.
It may be the very place where the truest story begins.
