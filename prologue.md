## Prologue — The Phrase That Woke Me

The dream: “The God Who Sees.” The story of the dishes with your wife. The human ache beneath everyday conflicts. The meaning crisis, loneliness, and cultural longing to be seen. This book is both personal and universal: an invitation into a mystery, not a manual.
