## Prologue

This book is for the ones who slip quietly out the back pew, unnoticed.
For the ones who serve faithfully but are never thanked.
For the ones who ache for belonging and find only silence.
For the ones who gave their hearts to the church and were met with rejection.

This is for you, the overlooked, the uninvited, the misunderstood.

You may not carry the title of “chosen,” but you carry the weight of longing.
You may not stand in the spotlight, but you know the shadows well.
And in those shadows, Christ has always moved.

Jesus was found with outsiders more often than insiders.
He spoke with the woman at the well who came alone.
He honored the Roman soldier’s faith.
He welcomed the children no one valued.
He touched the leper no one dared to see.

The sting of being an outsider is not the end of your story.
It is the very place where God bends low to meet you.
It is the soil where compassion takes root.
It is the wilderness where the voice of Love still calls your name.

You are not forgotten.
You are not invisible.
You are not alone.

This book is my witness, and I pray it becomes yours too:
that in the very place you feel unseen,
you may come to know the God who sees.
